# Simon-Game
Created an interactive memory game.
 Simon Game challenges the memory retention capacity by
generating a sequence of colors for a player to repeat. After each
successful series of presses, “Simon” repeats the list followed by
an additional random color. Game play continues until the player
makes a mistake.
 Written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS
